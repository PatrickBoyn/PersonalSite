    <h1>About Me: </h1>
    <p> I have been programming seriously for the last 2 years. I have no professional experience, but part of the reason
        I wrote this website is so that I might be able to get one. I wanted to show that I have many of the skills
        needed for a junior position someplace. I started off with C#, and spent about a year with that.
        I have spent most of the rest of this time with Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The two languagesz
        I am best at are, Python and CSS. I am still fairly good at C#, but am looking for a position with Python.
        I am hoping to become a web developer.  </p>
