    <h1>About Me: </h1>
    <p>I have been programming off and on since about 2001.
       I never really took it very seriously until 2 years ago when I picked it back up again
       after a long time of not doing it. I decided this time I would learn enough to possibly
       get myself a job, and that is part of the aim of this website, is to show off a little.I can program in both
       C# and Python, I can also use HTML and CSS. I am decent in JavaScript. </p>
